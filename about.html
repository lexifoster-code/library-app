    Libraries are places of information
    Libraries are community hubs. In addition to connecting people 
    libraries connect people to people. They are safe havens 
    for kids when school is not in session, offering after school 
    homework help, games and book clubs. Libraries offer computer
     classes, enabling older adults stay engaged in a digital world.
      Bookmobiles and community outreach programs keep those living in 
      remote areas or those 
    who are homebound connected to the larger community.
